    <h1 id="title">The Evolve of World GDP in the Past Decades </h1> 
</div>
<p id="align"> The GDP around the world has changed dramatically in the past few decades. 
    Many countries witnessed huge economic growth and increased their GDP. However, the change depends 
    on the countries policies and the region they are located in. The following graphs will explore the 
    economic growth and GDP changes of the world in the past few decades.

    <p id="align"> Different countries had different growth rates depending on their annual growth and the location 
        of the country. As seen in the map above, East asian Countries have had the biggest increase in their GDP between 
        2000 and 2020 which is due to their industrial revolution. If we slide the year slider between 2000 and 2020, 
        it will be noticed that the Chinese GDP increased from 1.2 trillion dollar to 14.7 trillion dollars in 2020. 
        The Chinese GDP doubled more than 10 times in just 20 years. On the other side of the world, the western countries have witnessed a smaller growth in GDP. For instance, the UK GDP increased from 1.6 Trillion dollars in 2020 to 2.7 trillion dollars in 2020. So the UK GDP has not even doubled in 20 years. However, the western countries maintained their high GDP per capita which is a result of slow population growth. For instance, even though China witnessed a huge economic boost, the GDP per capita remained at 10 thousands USD as per 2020 while the GDP per capita in the United Kingdom is 41 thousand as of 2020.   </p>

    <h2 id="title">GDP Per Region in The Past Decades </h2> 
    <h3 id="secondtitle">GDP Growth % for Seven of the World Regions Between 1990 and 2020 </h3> 
</div>

    <div id="FOURTHGRAPH" id="align"> 
    </div>
    <p id="align"> Now moving to compare the GDP per region over the past few decades. The graph below shows the growth for seven regions of the world between 1990 and 2020. The graph shows that the asian regions have had the highest growth in these years. In 2020 most regions had negative growth as a result of the covid pandemic. However, East Asia had the lowest decrease in GDP (-0.13%) While the GDP of the European Union decreased by 6% in that year. </p>

 <h3 id="secondtitle">Difference in Total GDP for Each Region Between 1990 and 2020 (USD)</h3> 
    <div id="SECONDGRAPH" id="align"> 
    </div>
    <h3 id="secondtitle">Difference in GDP Per Capita for Each Region Between 1990 and 2020 (USD)</h3> 
    <div id="FIFTHGRAPH" id="align"> 
    </div>
    
    
    <p id="align"> The two graphs above illustrate the major changes in GDP in the last three decades. The graphs show the difference between the total GDP and GDP per capita in the selected seven regions between 1990 and 2020. The graphs illustrate the major changes in the eatern regions compared to the rest of the world. For instance the GDP in South Asia increased from 410 billions in 1990 to 3.4 Trillions in 2020. The GDP almost doubled 9 times. While the European Union GDP increased from 6.5 trillions dollars to 15 trillion dollars. The GDP doubled only one time. However, the European Union has a 34 thousands GDP per Capita in 2020 while South Asia has a 1.8 thousedan dollars per capita only as of 2020.   </p>
</div>
<p id="align">  The GDP of the world has significantly changed in the past few decades. New regions like the asian regions had major changes and became a GDP pole. However, the GDP per capita remained high in the western countries and relatively low in the rest of the regions.
