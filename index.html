<h3 id="title">GDP Per Country Between 2000 and 2020 </h3> 
    <div id="FIRSTGRAPH" id="align"> 
    </div>
    <p id="align"> The GDP around the world has changed in the past decades. Different countries had different 
        growth rates depending on their annual growth and the location of the country. As seen in the map above, 
        East asian Countries have had the biggest increase in their GDP between 2000 and 2020 which is due to their industrial revolution. 
        If we slide the year slider between 2000 and 2020, it will be noticed that the Chinese GDP increased from 1.2 trillion dollar to 14.7 trillion dollars in 2020. The Chinese GDP doubled more than 10 times in just 20 years period.
         On the other side of the world, the western countries have witnessed a smaller growth in GDP. For instance, 
        the UK GDP increased from 1.6 Trillion dollars in 2020 to 2.7 trillion dollars in 2020. 
        So the UK GDP has not even doubled in 20 years period.  </p>

    <div id="SECONDGRAPH" id="align"> 
        
    </div>
    <p id="align"> The graph above shows GDP size per region in 4 different decades (1970, 1990, 2000 and 2020).  
        It is for 7 different regions of the world (North America, European Union, East Asia, South Asia, Middle East and 
        North Africa, and Southern and Eatern Africa). The countries in these regions share economic connections 
        and have similar economic activities. It can be noticed that the GDP has grown signaffaclly across all regions
         between 1960 and 2020. East Asia has had the biggest growth as it has increased from less than half a trillion 
         dollars to a massive 27.1 Trillion dollars GDP. If the GDP growth keeps evolving at this rate in the next few years, 
         East Aisan countries will surpass the western countries GDP (Europe and North America. Also, it is noticed that 
         the African region had the lowest growth and has the current lowest GDP compared to the rest of the regions.  </p>
